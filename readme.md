##Setup
This widget requires an API key from the [Forecast.io API][api]. Before you use this widget, open `minimal-forecast.coffee`, and change the variable `apiKey` to the key you got from Forecast.io

##Configuration
There are three configuration variables at the top:

* **`apiKey`**: See above
* **`gridlinesEvery`** (*10*): The distance, in degrees, between the gridlines on the graph.
* **`units`** (*auto*): Temperature units to use. `auto`, the default, automatically selects units based on location. Other options include `si` for Celsius and `us` for Fahrenheit. See the [API documentation][units] for more information.
